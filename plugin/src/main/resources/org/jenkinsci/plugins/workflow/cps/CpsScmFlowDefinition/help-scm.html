<div>
    Specify where to obtain a source code repository containing your Groovy script.
    It will be checked out somewhere on the Jenkins master and used to load your Pipeline script.
    (If you wish to use other files from the same repository during your Pipeline,
    you will need to check them out separately on some slave;
    this checkout cannot be reused.)
