    If selected, try to obtain the Pipeline script contents directly from the SCM without performing a full checkout.
    The advantage of this mode is its efficiency; however, you will not get any changelogs or polling based on the SCM.
    (If you use <code>checkout scm</code> during the build, this will populate the changelog and initialize polling.)
    Also build parameters will not be substituted into SCM configuration in this mode.
    Only selected SCM plugins support this mode.
