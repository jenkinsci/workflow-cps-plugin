      Takes a map from branch names to closures and runs the closures in
      parallel. The optional <code>failFast</code> option terminates
      all jobs as soon as any job fails.

      Synopsis:
      <pre>
        parallel firstBranch: {
            // do something
          }, secondBranch: {
            // do something else
          },
          failFast: true|false
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      A branch succeeds if it returns normally. The actual value
      returned does not matter. A branch is considered to have failed if its
      closure exits by throwing an exception.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any branch fails, the <code>parallel</code> step will throw that
      exception once all branches have finished executing or been terminated,
      depending on <code>failFast</code> mode. Any non-identical exceptions
      thrown by other branches are added to the first exception as having been
      "suppressed by" the first exception; see
      <code>Throwable.addSuppresssed(...)</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that a <code>hudson.AbortException</code>, as thrown by failing
      steps, will stop and fail the branch but not produce a stack trace.
      This produces a:
      <pre>
      [branchname] Failed in branch branchname
      </pre>
      message without any details.
    </p>
    <p>
      To report results from branches to the outer script, use the closure's
      access to the outer scope's variables. For example, to run a shell script
      in parallel on each of a list of arguments and produce a map of argument
      to script stdout:
      <pre>
        def args = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
        def results = [:]
        // Produce a map of args to closures that use each arg
        branches = args.collectEntries { arg -&gt; [(arg): {
            def out = sh script: "./my-script.sh '${arg}'", returnStdout: true
            results &lt;&lt; [(arg): out]
            return null
          } ] }
        branches &lt;&lt; [failFast: true]
        parallel branches
      </pre>
      If all the scripts returned 0, the 'results' array contains a map of arg
      to shell stdout string. Otherwise <code>parallel</code> terminates the
      other branches and re-throws the <code>hudson.AbortException</code> from
      the first failed script.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: Branch closures should just return <code>null</code>. The return
      value of the <code>parallel</code> step should be ignored.
      <code>parallel</code> does capture the return values of closures and
      return a map of branch name to return value. But relying on this is not
      recommended and the behaviour is subject to change; See JENKINS-26033.
