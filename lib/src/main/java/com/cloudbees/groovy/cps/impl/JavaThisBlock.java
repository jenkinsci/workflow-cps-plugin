/**
 * Resolves the current {@link Env#closureOwner()} value.
 *
 * <p>
 * In Groovy, the {@code this} keyword and closure interacts and therefore
 * behaves differently from Java {@code this}. Specifically,
 * Groovy tries to maintain an illusion that closure is a part of the native language
 * feature and tries to hide the fact that it is implemented by another class.
 * 
 * <p>
 * So when executing inside a closure, like the following, {@code this} refers to
 * {@code Foo} instance, not the instance of the anonymous closure class, which is the actual
 * {@code this} as far as Java bytecode is concerned at the runtime.
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * class Foo {
 *   def foo() {
 *     def closure = { ->
 *       this.x = 1;     
 *     }
 *     closure();     
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * So let's refer to the Java version of {@code this} as {code javaThis}, and let's refer
 * to the Groovy version of {@code this} as {@code groovyThis}.
 *  
 * <p>
 * To make this more complicated, sometimes Groovy does need to refer to
 * {@code javaThis}, to be able to refer to the closure itself. This happens
 * when you call a method or access a property from inside the closure. In the following
 * code, where a closure makes an assignment to a "dynamic variable" {@code x}, the
 * actual translation of the code fragment is {@code javaThis.x=1} (which would call
 * {@link Closure#setProperty(String, Object)}), not {@code groovyThis.x=1} (which would call
 * {@code Foo#setProperty()}).
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * class Foo {
 *   def foo() {
 *     def closure = { ->
 *       x = 1;     
 *     }
 *     ...     
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Groovy defines no explicit syntax for {@code javaThis}. It can be only used implicitly.
